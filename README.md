# SPOT Desktop Application

This is a desktop version of [SPOT](https://github.com/NLeSC/spot).


SPOT is an interactive, fast, web-based visual analytics tool. It was primarily designed as data exploration and analysis tool for complex multidimensional datasets. It can be used to create and share dashboards to visualize tabular data stored in relational databases, or CSV and JSON files.

SPOT uses common visual analytics ideas like multiple coordinated views and drill down. It is also possible to connect to a Postresql database server to analyze big datasets.
